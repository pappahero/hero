# HOW TO - INSTALL THE FRAMWORK

### 1. How to clone the framework
At first you have to login to your studentserver with a commandlinetool. I recommend
that you use PuTTY. Navigate to the directory where you want the framework to be 
installed and write:
> git clone git://github.com/pappahero/hero.git

Now you should have a copy of the latest framework-version on your server.

### 2. Navigate to the installationpage
Navigate to the installationpage by writing the following url in your webbrowser:

> http://www.student.bth.se/~YOURUSERID/hero

Or if you use another server

> your.server/where-you-installed/ and follow the instructions there

### 3. Installing the framework
Be sure to check that your data-directory is writable, and also your directory 
where you have the LESS-files. If it isn't. Navigate to the directory hero and 
write:

> chmod 777 site/data
And
> chmod 777 themes

After that all you have to do is clicking the link that says module/install and the 
framework hero is ready for you!
