A `style.php` to autocompile LESS using lessphp
===============================================

This project is an example where lessphp is used for serverside compile LESS to CSS. The file `style.php` implements the function `autoCompileLess()` which is described in the lessphp manual. It add on gzip-encoding and enable sending header 304 Not Modified when the stylesheet has not changed.

The project includes the essentials from lessphp to make it a working example. Just clone it and point your browser to the catalogue. You need to make the catalogue writable for the webserver since lessphp creates a cache-file, `style.less.cache`, and writes the resulting `stylesheet.css`.

You can see the working example here:
